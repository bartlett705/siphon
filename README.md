# Siphon
Siphon is an easy-to-use data extraction library for Nodejs that is designed to work at scale by making use of Node's built-in clustering behavior by default. Siphon can make use of proxies to enable a higher volume of data extraction/web scraping. Siphon has also been set up to work on a cluster of servers with a Redis queue handling job assignment. Siphon requires the 'request' module as a dependency, and there are optional dependecies of selenium-webdriver and cheerio for jobs requiring DOM actions and full client-side rendering.
